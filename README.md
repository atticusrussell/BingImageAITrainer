## Setup

1. If you donâ€™t already have Python installed, install it now. You can [find it here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. Clone this repository.

3. Navigate into the project directory:

   ```bash
   $ cd bingimageaitrainer
   ```

4. Create a new virtual environment:

   ```bash
   $ python -m venv venv
   $ . venv/bin/activate
   ```

5. Install the requirements:

   ```bash
   $ pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

6. Modify `generate_prompts.py` based on what parameters you want to vary in the generated images, what you want images of, and how many images you want from each prompt. By default, four images are generated from every prompt to Bing Image Creator. You may need to tweak the prompt system significantly to consistently generate suitable images for your application.

## Getting Cookies
1. Open a web browser like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge

2. Log into a Microsoft account
-  NOTE: A Microsoft account can only create one unique cookie that will work for this

3. Open [bing.com/images/create](https://www.bing.com/images/create)

4. If you see a "Join & Create" button, click it. If not, you're already good to continue.

5. Install the cookie editor extension for [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cookie-editor/hlkenndednhfkekhgcdicdfddnkalmdm) or [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cookie-editor/)

6. Go to [bing.com](https://bing.com)

7. Open the extension

8. Click "Export" on the bottom right, then "Export as JSON" (This saves your cookies to clipboard)

9. Paste your cookies into a file `bing_cookies_*.json` in the `cookies` directory, where `*` indicates that what comes between it and the `.json` is irrelevant.

## Running the code

1. Populate `prompts.json` by running `python3 generate_prompts.py`

2. Make sure that you have Bing images cookie files in json format in the `cookies` directory

3. Generate images with `python3 bic_generate.py`

4. If the code crashes before images are generated for all prompts, run `python3 bic_generate.py` again. Don't worry; the generated images are tracked through removal from `prompts.json`, so they will not be re-generated.
